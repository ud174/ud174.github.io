I am a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University and a member of Wireless Intelligence Laboratory. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University, Turkey, in 2015 and 2017. My research focuses on the wireless communications and machine learning. As leisure activities, I enjoy hiking, running and cooking.
