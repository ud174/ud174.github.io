Welcome to my personal page! I'm pursuing my Ph.D. degree at Arizona State University as a member of Wireless Intelligence Laboratory. My research mainly focuses on wireless communications and machine learning applications. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2015 and 2017. As leisure activities, I enjoy hiking, running and cooking.
